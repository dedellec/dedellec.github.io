        <h2>Barbary Duck</h2>
        <p>Another name for the Barbary Duck, the Muscovy duck (<i>Cairina moschata</i>) is a large duck native to <strong>Mexico</strong>, <strong>Central,</strong> and <strong>South America</strong>. Small wild and feral breeding populations have established themselves in the <strong>United States</strong>, particularly in Florida and the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas as well as in many other parts of <strong>North America</strong>, including southern <strong>Canada</strong>. Feral Muscovy ducks are found in <strong>New Zealand</strong>, <strong>Australia</strong>, and in parts of <strong>Europe</strong>.</p>
        <p>They are large ducks, with the males about 76 cm (30 in) long, and weighing up to 7 kg (15 lb). Females are considerably smaller, and only grow to 3 kg (6.6 lb), roughly half the males' size. The bird is predominantly black and white, with the back feathers being iridescent and glossy in males, while the females are more drab. The amount of white on the neck and head is variable, as well as the bill, which can be yellow, pink, black, or any mixture of these. They may have white patches or bars on the wings, which become more noticeable during flight. Both sexes have pink or red wattles around the bill, those of the male being larger and more brightly colored.</p>
        <p>Although the Muscovy duck is a tropical bird, it adapts well to cooler climates. In general, Barbary duck is the term used for C. moschata in a culinary context.</p>
        <p>The domestic breed, <i>Cairina moschata domestica</i>, is commonly known in Spanish as the pato criollo ("creole duck"). They have been bred since pre-Columbian times by Native Americans and are heavier and less able to fly long distances than the wild subspecies. Their plumage color is also more variable. Other names for the domestic breed in Spanish are pato casero ("backyard duck") and pato mudo ("mute duck").</p>

        <h5>Eider Duck</h5>
        <p>Eiders are large seaducks in the genus <i>Somateria</i>. The scientific name is derived from Ancient Greek somatos "body" and erion "wool", referring to eiderdown.</p>
        <p>The three extant species all breed in the cooler latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p>The down feathers of eider ducks, and some other ducks and geese, are used to fill pillows and quilts - they have given the name to the type of quilt known as an eiderdown.</p>
        <p>Steller's eider (<i>Polysticta stelleri</i>) is in a different genus despite its name.</p>
        <p>The call of the duck has been likened to sound of "surprised pantomime dames, or even the comedian Frankie Howerd".</p>
        <h6><small>Golden Cascade</small></h6>
        <p>The Golden Cascade is a breed of domestic duck developed in the <strong>United States</strong>. In 1979, David Holderread of Corvallis, Oregon set out to breed a duck that was fast growing, active, laid eggs well, and was auto-sexing. By the mid-1980s, the Golden Cascade was introduced to the market. It is not yet admitted to the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection.</p>
        <p><small>The Golden Cascade was so named because of its golden hue, and for the prominent Cascade Range of the Northwest. They weigh 6-8 pounds (2.7-3.6 kilos). Females have Fawn or buff plumage and Orange beaks with brown markings. Drakes have yellow beaks, Satin green or Bronze heads, white ring on their necks, reddish breasts and white underbodies. The throat can turn light fawn. Older drakes can molt to a fawn or buff that covers the head and body but First year birds should have a chestnut chest with the classic golden buff to white shoulders, sides and belly. The ducklings may be sexed by down color: darker for males, lighter for females.</small></p>
